# BLK - Faceit Blacklist

BLK (Faceit Blacklist) is a Python application that uses the Faceit API to analyze players in a match. You enter a match link, and the app displays each player, allowing you to add comments about them. This helps you remember how they played in past matches, whether as an opponent or a teammate. Players are identified by their ID, so you can track them even if they change their nickname.

## Installation

1. Download the `BLK.7z` archive.
2. Extract the files.
3. Run `BLK.exe`.

## Usage

1. Enter the Faceit match link.
2. The app will display the list of players.
3. Add comments for each player.
4. Comments are saved and can be used for future reference.
